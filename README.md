# vim

This repo is just a backup of my ~/.vim/vimrc and ~/.clang-format files. I may
enhance it in the future.

My setup is MacOS with Homebrew installed. I am using the brew vim and llvm
packages as well as clang-format. At the moment, I'm not doing anything
fancy. In fact, I'm trying to keep things as simple as possible.

```bash
brew install vim clang-format llvm
```

Copy the vimrc file to ~/.vim/vimrc
Copy the clang-format file to ~/.clang-format

This yeilds a basic vim setup with the code style I currently use.
